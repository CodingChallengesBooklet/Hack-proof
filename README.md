## Problem
Create a program that will only open a text document if the correct password is entered. The user should choose the username and password first and it should also verify the password before allowing it

### Extension
1. Create a random password first of at least 8 characters first as a suggested password
2. Create a random password that contains at least a lowercase, uppercase and special character of at least 8 characters in length
3. Verify that the password given by the user matches:
    a. The limits in Extension 1 above
    b. The limits in Extension 2 above
